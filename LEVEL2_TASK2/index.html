            <h2>EARLY LIFE</h2>
            <p>
              Ratan Tata was born on December 28, 1937, in Bombay (now Mumbai),
              India. He was born into the prominent Tata family, which had a
              significant impact on the business landscape of India. He
              completed his early education in Mumbai and later attended Cornell
              University and Harvard Business School. Ratan Tata was born in
              Bombay, now Mumbai, during the British Raj, on 28 December 1937.He
              is the son of Naval Tata, who was born in Surat and later adopted
              into the Tata family, and Sooni Tata, the niece of Tata group
              founder Jamsetji Tata. Tata's biological grandfather, Hormusji
              Tata, was a member of the Tata family by blood. In 1948, when Tata
              was 10, his parents separated, and he was subsequently raised and
              adopted by Navajbai Tata, his grandmother and widow of Ratanji
              Tata. He has a younger brother Jimmy Tata and a half-brother, Noel
              Tata, from Naval Tata's second marriage with Simone Tata, with
              whom he was raised. He studied at the Campion School, Mumbai till
              the 8th class. After which, he studied at the Cathedral and John
              Connon School in Mumbai, the Bishop Cotton School in Shimla, and
              the Riverdale Country School in New York City, which he graduated
              from in 1955. After graduating from high school, Tata enrolled in
              Cornell University, from which he graduated with a bachelor's
              degree in architecture in 1959. In 2008, Tata gifted Cornell $50
              Million, becoming the largest international donor in the
              university's history.

          <section id="career">
            <h2>CAREER</h2>
            <p>
              Ratan Tata's career is closely associated with the Tata Group, one
              of India's largest and most respected conglomerates. He joined the
              Tata Group in 1962 and steadily rose through the ranks. In 1991,
              he became the chairman of Tata Sons, the holding company of the
              Tata Group.In the 1970s, Tata was given a managerial position in
              the Tata group. He achieved initial success by turning the
              subsidiary National Radio and Electronics (NELCO) around, only to
              see it collapse during an economic slowdown.In 1991, J. R. D. Tata
              stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming him his successor.
              Initially, Tata faced stiff resistance from the heads of various
              subsidiaries, who had a large amount of operational freedom under
              the senior Tata's tenure. In response, Tata implemented a number
              of policies designed to consolidate power, including the
              implementation of a retirement age, having subsidiaries report
              directly to the group office, and requiring subsidiaries to
              contribute their profit to building the Tata group brand. Tata
              prioritised innovation and delegated many responsibilities to
              younger talent.Under his leadership, overlapping operations
              between subsidiaries were streamlined into company-wide
              operations, with the group exiting unrelated businesses to take on
              globalisation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Under his leadership, the Tata Group expanded globally, acquiring
              several renowned companies and achieving significant growth. Some
              notable acquisitions include Jaguar Land Rover and Corus Group.
